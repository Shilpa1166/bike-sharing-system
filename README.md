This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the demand for shared bikes in a bike-sharing system. By understanding the demand drivers, businesses can tailor their strategies to increase efficiency and profitability.    
**Background:**
Bike-sharing systems provide an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution for urban transportation. With the growing popularity of bike-sharing services, understanding the demand dynamics is essential for companies to optimize resources and improve service quality.

**Business Problem:**
BoomBikes, a bike-sharing service provider, aims to understand the factors influencing bike demand in the post-pandemic period. The company seeks to model bike demand based on different variables (e.g., weather, season, holidays, etc.) to optimize their operations and forecast demand.

**Dataset: **
The dataset consists of daily bike rental information with variables such as weather, season, year, and holidays. The target variable is the total count of bike rentals (cnt), which includes both casual and registered users.


**Technologies Used**
Python - Version 3.9

pandas - Version 1.2.4

numpy - Version 1.20.1

matplotlib - Version 3.3.4

seaborn - Version 0.11.1

scikit-learn - Version 0.24.2

**Conclusions**
Seasonality and Weather Impact: The analysis indicates that weather conditions and season have a strong influence on bike-sharing demand. For instance, mild weather and spring/fall seasons lead to higher bike rentals.

Yearly Trends: The year (yr) variable shows an increasing demand trend, suggesting that the bike-sharing system is gaining popularity, which can help in forecasting future demand.

Impact of Holidays: The presence of holidays significantly impacts the demand, with higher rentals observed during non-working days, indicating the importance of considering special dates for planning purposes.

Key Features: The final model identified variables like temperature, weather situation, and hour as the most important predictors for bike demand, emphasizing the importance of weather and time of day in the model.
